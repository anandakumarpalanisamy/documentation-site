# Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform

Welcome to Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform!

This project contains a collection of Amazon EKS cluster patterns implemented in Terraform that
demonstrate how fast and easy it is for customers to adopt [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
The patterns can be used by AWS customers, partners, and internal AWS teams to configure and manage
complete EKS clusters that are fully bootstrapped with the operational software that is needed to
deploy and operate workloads.
